# Find Your Electoral Division

## Why This Matters

Before we can talk about how constituency boundaries affect you, you need to know **where you are** in the system.

Every address in Ireland falls within a specific **Electoral Division (ED)**. Your ED is the fundamental building block of the electoral system - it groups with other EDs to form your constituency.

**Key Question:** Do you know which Electoral Division you live in, and why that matters?

---

## What Is an Electoral Division?

Think of Electoral Divisions as the **Lego blocks** of Ireland's electoral system.

### The Basics

**Electoral Divisions (EDs)** are:
- Small geographic areas with clearly defined boundaries
- The smallest official administrative units in Ireland
- Used by the Central Statistics Office (CSO) for census data
- The **building blocks** for creating constituencies

**The Numbers:**
- **3,440 Electoral Divisions** in total across Ireland
- Each ED contains roughly **80-200 homes**
- Average population per ED: **around 1,400 people**
- EDs vary significantly in size - urban EDs are geographically smaller but have higher populations

### The Hierarchy

Here's how you fit into Ireland's electoral system:

```
Your Address
    ↓
Your Electoral Division (ED)
    ↓
Your Constituency (groups of EDs)
    ↓
Your TDs (3, 4, or 5 per constituency)
    ↓
Dáil Éireann (160 TDs total)
```

**Example:**
- **Address**: 123 Main Street, Dublin
- **ED**: Rathmines West C
- **Constituency**: Dublin Bay South
- **TDs**: 4 TDs represent this constituency
- **Your vote**: Helps elect one of those 4 TDs

## Why Electoral Divisions Matter

EDs are more than just administrative boundaries. They're **crucial for redistricting** because:

### 1. EDs Are Indivisible

When the Electoral Commission draws constituency boundaries:
- **EDs cannot be split** - each ED must belong entirely to one constituency
- This is the fundamental constraint of Irish redistricting
- Think of it like a jigsaw puzzle where you can't cut the pieces

**What this means:**
If your ED has 1,500 people, those 1,500 people **must** all be in the same constituency. The Commission can't divide your ED between two constituencies.

### 2. EDs Group Together

Constituencies are formed by grouping EDs:
- A 3-seat constituency might contain 60-90 EDs
- A 5-seat constituency might contain 100-150 EDs
- The Commission's job: figure out which EDs should group together

### 3. Population Data Lives in EDs

The CSO (Central Statistics Office) collects census data by ED:
- Population counts
- Demographic information
- Housing data
- Geographic boundaries

This data is what the Electoral Commission uses to calculate:
- **Variance** (is this constituency too big or too small?)
- **Population balance** across constituencies
- **Projected growth** for future planning

```{important}
**Your ED is your democratic address.** Just like your postal address determines which mail you receive, your Electoral Division determines:
- Which constituency you vote in
- Which TDs represent you
- How your vote is weighted relative to others
```

```

```{tip}
**Don't have your Eircode handy?**
- Use the map browser to zoom into your area and click
- Or search by landmark (e.g., "Trinity College Dublin")
- The tool will show you the ED boundaries visually
```

## Understanding Your ED

Once you've found your ED, here's what the information tells you:

### Population Size

**Why it matters:**
- Larger EDs have more influence on constituency calculations
- Small EDs are easier to swap between constituencies
- Population changes within an ED affect the whole constituency

**Example:**
```
ED: Rathmines West C
Population: 1,234 people
```

If this ED is in a 4-seat constituency with average 33,000 people per TD, this ED represents about **0.93%** of one TD's constituents.

### Geographic Size

**Why it matters:**
- Urban EDs: small area, high population density
- Rural EDs: large area, low population density
- Shape affects **compactness** of constituencies

**Visual Comparison:**

```
Urban ED (Dublin):              Rural ED (Kerry):
┌──┐  500m × 500m               ┌────────────┐
│  │  Population: 1,500         │            │  5km × 5km
└──┘                            │            │  Population: 1,500
                                └────────────┘
```

Both have the same population, but very different geography. This creates challenges for drawing compact constituencies.

### County Location

**Why it matters:**
- Irish electoral law mentions "respect for county boundaries"
- Breaking counties is politically sensitive
- Your county identity might not match your constituency

**Case Study:**

```
ED: Portlaoise Urban
County: Laois
Current Constituency: Laois-Offaly (5 seats)
2023 Recommendation: Move to Kildare South

→ Your county stays the same (Laois)
→ But your constituency changes
→ You'd now vote with Kildare voters, not Offaly voters
```

## Your ED's Boundaries

Let's explore what your ED boundary actually means.

### How Boundaries Are Defined

ED boundaries follow:
- **Roads and streets** (e.g., "north side of Main Street")
- **Natural features** (rivers, coastlines)
- **Administrative boundaries** (townlands in rural areas)
- **Development boundaries** (edges of housing estates)

### Visualizing Your ED

```{raw} html
<iframe src="../_static/ed_boundary_viewer.html" width="100%" height="800px" frameborder="0" style="border: 3px solid #9B7DC8; border-radius: 12px; margin: 20px 0;"></iframe>
```

### Understanding the Borders

Your ED's borders with neighboring EDs are important because:

1. **Contiguity Requirement**: Constituencies must be connected. If your ED is at the edge of a constituency, it must touch another ED in the same constituency.

2. **Swap Possibilities**: EDs on constituency borders are the easiest to move during redistricting. If your ED borders another constituency, it's a candidate for swapping.

3. **Community Cohesion**: ED boundaries often follow natural community divisions. Moving an ED to a different constituency might split a community.

## Your ED in Context

Now let's see how your ED fits into the bigger picture.

### Current Constituency Membership

```

### Historical Constituency Membership

Has your ED always been in the same constituency? Let's find out.

```{raw} html
<iframe src="../_static/ed_history_timeline.html" width="100%" height="900px" frameborder="0" style="border: 3px solid #9B7DC8; border-radius: 12px; margin: 20px 0;"></iframe>
```

```{note}
**Understanding Stability:**
- **High stability**: ED has stayed in the same constituency for 30+ years
- **Moderate stability**: ED has changed 1-2 times in 40 years
- **Low stability**: ED has changed 3+ times, often at constituency borders
```

## Why Knowing Your ED Empowers You

Now that you know your Electoral Division, you can:

### 1. Track Changes That Affect You

When the Electoral Commission announces boundary recommendations:
- Search for **your ED by name**
- See if it's proposed to move to a different constituency
- Understand the specific impact on your representation

### 2. Make Informed Submissions

During public consultations, you can:
- Reference your specific ED in submissions
- Explain how changes would affect your community
- Use population data to support your arguments
- Compare with neighboring EDs to suggest alternatives

**Example Submission:**

> "I live in ED Rathmines West C, which the Commission proposes to move from Dublin Bay South to Dublin Rathdown. This change would:
> - Separate our community from neighboring Rathmines EDs
> - Move us away from the natural catchment area of our schools and services
> - Create a less compact constituency shape
>
> I suggest considering [alternative configuration] instead, which would maintain community cohesion while still meeting the variance requirement."

### 3. Evaluate Commission Reasoning

When the Commission publishes their report, you can:
- Check if your ED is mentioned specifically
- Understand why it was moved (or kept in place)
- Assess whether the reasoning makes sense
- Compare the stated rationale with the actual data

### 4. Connect with Your Community

Share your ED knowledge:
- Discuss boundary changes with neighbors
- Organize community responses to consultations
- Help others in your ED understand the implications
- Build collective voice for your area

## Interactive Exploration

Want to explore more? Try these activities:

### Activity 1: Explore Your Neighbors

**Task:** Find and map all the EDs that border yours.

**Questions to consider:**
- Are they in the same constituency?
- Do they have similar population sizes?
- Do they share community characteristics?

### Activity 2: Compare with Other Parts of Ireland

**Task:** Pick an ED in a rural county and compare with yours.

**Look at:**
- Population size difference
- Geographic size difference
- Constituency type (3, 4, or 5 seats)
- Variance levels

### Activity 3: Trace Your ED's Journey

**Task:** Look up your ED's constituency membership over time.

**Discover:**
- When did it last change?
- Why did it change?
- What was the public reaction?

## Common Questions

### "My ED seems really small. Is that normal?"

Yes! ED sizes vary dramatically:
- **Smallest EDs**: Around 200-300 people (often in city centers)
- **Average EDs**: Around 1,400 people
- **Largest EDs**: Around 4,000-5,000 people (rapidly growing areas)

The variation exists because:
- EDs were defined at different times
- Population has shifted since ED boundaries were set
- Urban vs. rural differences

### "Can ED boundaries change?"

Rarely. ED boundaries are set by the Ordnance Survey and CSO, and they change very infrequently - usually only when:
- Major new developments are built
- Administrative reorganization is needed
- Census requirements change

**Constituency boundaries** change regularly (every 4-5 years on average), but **ED boundaries** are much more stable.

### "Why does my ED have a weird name?"

ED names often reflect:
- Historical townland names
- Directional divisions (North, South, East, West)
- Alphabetical subdivisions (A, B, C, D)
- Local landmarks

Example: "Rathmines West C" means:
- **Rathmines**: The area name
- **West**: The western section of Rathmines
- **C**: The third subdivision of Rathmines West (A and B also exist)
