# Module 0: Why This Matters

Welcome to the beginning of your journey into understanding democratic redistricting in Ireland.

## Your Starting Point

Before we explore algorithms, mathematics, or electoral systems, let's start with something immediate and personal: **your vote and your representation**.

Most Irish citizens don't realize that some votes effectively carry more weight than others - not because of fraud, but because of how constituency boundaries are drawn.

## What You'll Discover

In this module, you'll learn:

- **Why your vote might not count equally** compared to voters in other constituencies
- **How to find your Electoral District** and understand your place in the system
- **What drives boundary changes** and why your area might be affected next
- **How the 2023 controversy** broke with decades of precedent

## The Three Core Questions

### 1. Why Should I Care?

Your representation in Dáil Éireann depends on constituency boundaries. When these boundaries shift, your voice in democracy shifts with them.

### 2. Where Am I in the System?

Every address in Ireland falls within a specific Electoral District. Understanding your ED is the first step to understanding redistricting.

### 3. Could This Affect Me?

Boundaries have changed 10 times since 1980. They'll change again. Will your area be affected?

## Learning Path

This module takes approximately **30-45 minutes** to complete and requires no prior knowledge of electoral systems or mathematics.

**Recommended approach:**
1. Complete lessons in order
2. Take time with the reflection questions
3. Find your own ED to make it personal
4. Move to Module 1 when ready

**Quick path:**
- Skim the key takeaways in each lesson
- Focus on the interactive elements
- Jump to Module 1 for deeper content

## What Makes This Different

Unlike traditional civics education, we start with **your actual experience as a voter** rather than abstract principles. Only after you understand why this matters personally do we build up the technical details.

This approach ensures that when you encounter complexity in later modules, you'll understand **why it's worth learning**.

## Ready to Begin?

The first lesson reveals something most Irish voters never discover: the hidden inequality in how votes are weighted across constituencies.
